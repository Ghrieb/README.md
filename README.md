# Hi there! I'm Ghrieb ! 🌟

## Who is Ghrieb ? 

Hey, I'm Ghrieb 👋 I'm a student building bridges between two worlds, I'm from Algiers, Currently I'm on a learning adventure at the University of Science and Technology Houari Boumediene (USTHB), studying Biology. Simultaneously, I'm dipping my toes into the world of Computer Science at the University of the People (UoPeople). When I'm not buried in books, you can find me freelancing on Fiverr, tinkering with AI.

🎓 Microsoft Certified Trainer in AI:
- I've done some cool AI learning stuff.
- Spent quite a bit of time learning, almost 42 hours!
- I love sharing what I know to help others get into AI too.

## What's Next? 🚀
In 2024, I'm eyeing UI/UX design. It sounds fun, right?
By the end of 2024, I aim to establish myself as an active member of the GitHub community, having made meaningful contributions that reflect my passion for technology and innovation.
